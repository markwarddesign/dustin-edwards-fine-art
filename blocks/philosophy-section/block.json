        "Each sculpture begins with a search for truth—truth in gesture, personality, and emotion. I strive to create bronze pieces that not only represent a subject, but embody its essence. When a viewer feels a spark of connection—a sense of presence, motion, or emotion—I consider the work successful.",
        "Growing up in a sculptor's studio and immersed in the landscapes of Idaho, I learned to see the world with curiosity and reverence. My goal is to create art that inspires reflection, evokes feeling, and brings life to stillness. Ultimately, I hope my work speaks differently to each person, while inviting everyone to feel something real."
